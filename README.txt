This program works to put animal remodels into your game and different versions of the Main.ovl file in the content0 folder
and to download mods from the Internet.

The program is run through the gui.py.

How to add mods manually:
The mods folder is located in the dist folder.
To start adding mods create a folder with the modfiles inside in the mods/animal you want to replace folder.
An example animal is in the mods folder to illustrate the process. 
If you want to use the animal loader with a mod that only alters one gender of an animal, then you have
to copy the the other genders form and the juvenile form from the base game into your mod folder.

How to download mods from the Internet using the built in downloader:
Click the download button. Find a animal you want to use and click download. Then select the animal in the loader.

If you don't get a message saying your mods have loaded or the program doesn't open an error has occurred.
Possible Problems:
-One of your mod folders in each animal folder isn't empty
-You put in the incorrect directory
